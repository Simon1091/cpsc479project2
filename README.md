Main steps of the K-means algorithm are described by
Jain and Dubes [11] as follows:
a) Select an initial partition with K clusters; repeat
steps b and c until cluster memberships stabilize.
b) Generate a new partition by assigning each pattern
to its closest cluster center.
c) Compute new cluster centers.
